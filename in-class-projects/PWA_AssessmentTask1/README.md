<h1 align="center">🌐 Year 12 Assessment Task 1 – Progressive Web Application</h1> <h3 align="center">A dynamic PWA integrating responsive design, database communication, and real-time search functionality.</h3>

---

🧩 **Overview**  
This project demonstrates a Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with modern web technologies. It showcases how front-end interactivity, backend data management, and database communication can be combined to deliver a responsive, installable, and user-friendly application. The system emphasizes real-time search, dynamic rendering, and database relationships through foreign keys.

🧮 **Features**  
🖼️ Dynamic Frontend Rendering Generates HTML content dynamically from backend data with each new entry, ensuring seamless updates without page reloads.  

🎨 Responsive CSS Animations Provides interactive visual feedback through animations triggered by user actions, enhancing engagement and usability.  

🗄️ Dual Database Integration Implements two relational databases connected via foreign keys, enabling efficient communication and data consistency across modules.  

🔍 AJAX Search System Real-time search with keystroke detection and bounceback delay, allowing users to query data without refreshing or filtering the entire page.  

🚀 Performance Filtering Includes filtering by top speed values retrieved directly from the database, showcasing advanced query handling.  

📡 Central Request Management A main server-side file listens for incoming requests, processes them, and returns structured responses to the frontend.

🧠 **Technical Highlights**  
Progressive Web App Design: Installable, offline-capable, and responsive across devices.  

Database Communication: Foreign key relationships ensure relational integrity and efficient cross-table queries.  

AJAX Implementation: Smooth asynchronous data retrieval without disrupting the user interface.  

Responsive UI/UX: CSS animations and adaptive layouts provide a polished, modern experience.  

Scalable Architecture: Modular backend design supports future expansion and additional features.  

Search Optimization: Bounceback delay prevents excessive queries, balancing responsiveness with performance.
